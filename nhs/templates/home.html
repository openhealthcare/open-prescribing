      Every month, the <a href="http://www.ic.nhs.uk/home">NHS Information Centre</a>
      publishes an open dataset of the UK's
      <a href="http://www.ic.nhs.uk/gpprescribingdata">GP prescribing activity</a>.
      Roughly ten million records each month. Which is brilliant for openness, transparency
      and enabling research, but not particularly friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Open Prescribing offers a free public API for anyone to build visualisations and
      answer questions about GP prescribing habits, along with sample applications that
      make use of the data in interesting ways.

      The continued use of metered-dose inhalers in respiratory care will have a potentially
      catastrophic effect on global warming if production is not controlled 2, largely because these
      inhalers use potent green-house gas hydroflourocarbons (HFCs) as propellants.

        So it turns out that the <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/">NHS</a> open sources all of
        it's <a href="http://www.ic.nhs.uk/services/transparency/prescribing-by-gp-practice">GP prescribing data</a>.

        Here, we turn those CSV's into several things:

         <li>
           An API that you can call to do useful things with the data
         </li>
         <li>
           A whole bunch of visualisations that are somewhat interesting (Provided you have <i>some</i> intellectual
           curiosity).
